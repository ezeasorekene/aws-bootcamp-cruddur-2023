### Create an Admin User

In my AWS Organization, I created a new AWS account. In the new AWS account, I created a new user called `awsbootcamp` and attached the `AdministratorAccess` policy the user. I also setup multi-factor authentication on both the root and the new admin accounts.

### Generate AWS Credentials

I generated the AWS credentials to access the AWS CLI as seen in the image below.

### Install and Verify AWS CLI

I already have AWS CLI installed on my MacBook. So I had to run the following command to print out the version and bin location.

```
which aws
aws --version
```

I created a new account under my organization and then created a new key pair that I used to configure a new profile for the aws cli as seen below

```
aws configure --profile AWSBootcamp2023
```

aws sts get-caller-identity --profile AWSBootcamp2023
